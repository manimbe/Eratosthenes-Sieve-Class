# Eratosthenes_Sieve_Class
### C++ Class for the Sieve of Eratosthenes

Looking for the prime numbers in a range by brute force is not as efficient as it could be. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an old but ingenious algorithm to approach this problem.

My interest in this topic started with a mathematical problem in the Euler Project, in which you have to find the sum of all prime numbers in between zero and two million. This class was devised for improving the performance of a brute-force algorithm, and then, I upgraded this idea with a couple more methods.

There is a header file and an implementation file; also there is a "main.cpp" which include examples of the class methods (to see how to use them).
